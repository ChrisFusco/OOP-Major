## Description:

This program is a game system containing 2 games: Tic Tac Toe and Snakes & Ladders. The user will use the command line interface of the game system to choose a game to load and play. Once the game loads, the user will use the gameâ€™s command line interface to play the game. Each game will have a slightly different interface and will store statistics of your game session that the user may check at any time using the implemented command system. The user may quit and load a different game at any time, and when they are finished using the game system they can shut it down.



## Specification:

The program should allow users to use a command line interface to select and play a number of games within the game system. The games should track statistics and be able to be played over again until the user decides to exit the game or the system entirely. A simple command system should enhance the quality of life aspect of the system, such as stopping/quitting midway through a game.
